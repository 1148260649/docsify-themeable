## Features

- **Flexible theme system based on CSS custom properties**<br>
  Theme settings are presented as a flat list of logically-named of [CSS custom properties](customization). There's no need to navigate or modify a theme's source, allowing changes to be made quickly and confidently.

- **No packages to install or static files to build**<br>
  All processing is done in the browser so there's no need to compile your CSS. Just link to a theme, then set [theme-related CSS custom properties](customization) as needed. That's it.

- **Multiple production-ready themes available**<br>
  Use any theme as-is or as a starting point for something completely new. All themes share the same customizable properties, making it easy mix styles from different themes.

- **Enhanced features and compatibility**<br>
  [PrimsJS theme compatibility](customization#primsjs), [responsive tables](options#responsivetables), and [modular scale typography](customization#base) are just a few of the enhanced features available, along with improved desktop and mobile browser compatibility.

- **Legacy browser support (IE10+)**<br>
  Thoroughly tested and compatible with legacy browsers, including support for CSS custom properties.
